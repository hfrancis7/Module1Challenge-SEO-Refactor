# Module1Challenge-SEO-Refactor
This is the UCF Fall 2022 Coding Bootcamp Week 1 Challenge.
The code originally provided was for a website promoting a business called "Horiseon."
The task was to refactor the code so that it would comply with accessability standards.

Clicking on the options in the top-right of the navigation bar takes you to the section on the page that the option is associated with. For example, clicking on the "Search Engine Optimization" option moves the mage to the "Search Engine Optimization section."

The website describes different ways search engine optimization can affect a business, as well as noting the importance of social media for social marketing.
